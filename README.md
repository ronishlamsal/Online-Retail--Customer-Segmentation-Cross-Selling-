Project Description
Analyzed customer purchasing behavior using the RFM model (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) to identify segments of high-value, moderate, and low-value customers.
Utilized K-Means clustering for initial segmentation and explored advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost for supervised analysis.
Applied FP-Growth algorithm for market basket analysis to discover product associations, enabling the generation of targeted cross-selling recommendations.
Data was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Online Retail dataset, containing UK-based transaction records.
Challenges faced include data quality issues (e.g., inconsistent product descriptions) and managing the balance between the granularity of clusters and interpretability.
Data cleaning, processing, and feature engineering played a crucial role in ensuring accurate clustering and modeling.
